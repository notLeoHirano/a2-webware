## Shape competition
A user can submit a shape created using a simple polygon tool, with the user's name, the shape name, the description, and whether or not the shape is named after the user.

Simple instructions are provided on the page

Flexbox columns are used to separate the infobar and the canvas

Positional styling is used for nearly every element, particularly by id and tag, as there are not enough repeating elements necessary for classes.

Examples: Table, rows, buttons, canvas, body, svg, info
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used a toggle button and dropdown to view all current data submitted. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Ability to revert and preview other shapes

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Branchaud summary - The problems mostly were with the barebones UI. Alot of the styling work could be put into the fonts, colors, background, and contrast to make certain parts pop out better. He thought the idea of a shape competition seemed hard to design for because the purpose is abstract in the first place, which surprised me. I think I could repurpose the code in a way that could solve a different problem, as Shape competition is a bit too open ended.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Behilo summary - (Aidan Behilo is my Civil Engineering roomate) I wanted to get feedback from someone without technical knowledge of web development. My roomate said that it was strange that the website had modern styling in the form when the concept is kind of retro, which was both helpful and surprising. I think I might reduce some of the modern styling if I were to go back.
